<p class="noindent"><span class="dropcap">L</span>ate on a Tuesday night I was trying to set up three boulders just right to fall on players as they came up a trail. But they fell too soon or too late, or not at all, because the simulation had no interest in my wishes whatsoever. Lisa knocked on my desk.</p>
<p class="calibre9">“Come here,” she said. “I want to show you something I got running.”</p>
<p class="calibre9">“All I want to do is kill,” I said. “It’s all I want now.”</p>
<p class="calibre9">“Come on.” She grabbed my sleeve and pulled.</p>
<p class="calibre9">“Okay, okay.” She led me to the outskirts of the cubicle settlement, where a table was piled with ugly-looking hardware. Virtual-reality headsets; bulky, dorky motion-sensing goggles.</p>
<p class="calibre9">“Why do we have these?” I asked.</p>
<p class="calibre9">“We get them free for supporting them. I’ve got it running now, try it out.”</p>
<p class="calibre9">I picked one up. “This weighs, like, ten pounds. Who buys these?”</p>
<p class="calibre9">“As far as I can tell, nobody ever in the history of the world,” she said. “Come on, I spent two days on this.”</p>
<p class="calibre9">“I’m going to look stupid.”</p>
<p class="calibre9">“Everybody does. Even the models on the side of the box do.”</p>
<p class="calibre9">I put it on. The display was like having a pair of tiny, low-resolution TV screens two inches from your eyeballs. It was showing bright static. “Jesus,” I said. “Just tell me when I can open my eyes.”</p>
<p class="calibre9">I heard her typing. “Now.” I opened them.</p>
<p class="calibre9"><a id="page-297"></a>“So?” It was Endoria on a tiny low-resolution screen.</p>
<p class="calibre9">“Turn your head.”</p>
<p class="calibre9">I did, and my view turned, too.</p>
<p class="calibre9">“I… oh, my God.” It was stuttery and low-resolution, but it was as if the borders of the monitor had fallen away and the rendered world spread to engulf me. I looked down at myself, half expecting to see a medieval tunic. I looked up into the blue sky and right into the sun, which gave fake lens flare, as if seen through a nonexistent camera. The air of the office felt Endorian. The hair on my arms stood up; a part of my brain was afraid and yet very, very happy.</p>
<p class="calibre9">“How come nobody knows about this?”</p>
<p class="calibre9">“Because everything about it sucks.”</p>
<p class="calibre9">I felt weightless. It felt like—</p>
<p class="calibre9">“Did Simon ever get to try this?” I asked.</p>
<p class="calibre9">“No.”</p>
<p class="calibre9">“Where are you?” I said.</p>
<p class="calibre9">“Here.” Somewhere back on earth I felt her take my hand, tightly. For a minute, I felt like Simon wanted to feel.</p>
