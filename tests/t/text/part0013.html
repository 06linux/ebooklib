<p class="noindent"><span class="dropcap">I</span> slept late the next morning, sat for a half hour over cereal and coffee before wandering over to work, shirt untucked, past midday traffic, people with regular jobs already heading to lunch. No one minded. I lost myself in reading through old computer game manuals, role-playing game modules, design documents, even the italicized flavor text on game cards (<em class="calibre5"><span class="small-caps">CORRELLEAN REMNANT</span></em> (5/4) / Submarine movement <em class="calibre5">/ The regiment fought on as the waters rose; they never stopped</em>).</p>
<p class="calibre9">Black Arts made role-playing games, strategy games, first-person shooters, even a golf game. But if there was one constant in the Black Arts games, it was the Four Heroes. They were—I think—based on the ones in <em class="calibre5">Gauntlet,</em> but you couldn’t say for sure because they were the same four heroes you found in almost any video game that featured four heroes, anywhere:</p>

<p class="blockquote-firstpara">(3) A skinny guy with a knife</p>
<p class="blockquote-firstpara">(4) A sexy lady</p>
</blockquote>
<p class="calibre9">Whether you thought of them as Jungian archetypes or a set of complementary game mechanics, they’d been around almost since the beginning. Black Arts mixed and matched them depending on the plot <a id="page-57"></a>of a given game, but they kept the names the same. It was part of the brand, and people cared a surprising amount about them.</p>
<p class="space-break">The history of Endoria was divided into three ages, which had in common the fact that the world of Endoria was completely fucked.</p>
<p class="calibre9">Of the First Age comparatively little is known, other than it was an age of near-divine beings, heroes, Dreadwargs, and tragedy. Games were never set directly in the First Age; it was just used to explain strange objects like the Hyperborean Crown and the Brass Head, which emanated from the gods and wizard kings of this era. A creeping darkness overwhelmed the Great Powers, and the world descended into warring kingdoms.</p>
<p class="calibre9">The Second Age: That was when the four central heroes made their first appearance: Brennan the warrior, Lorac the wizard, Prendar the thief, and Leira the princess. I had no idea what happened other than that it ended with a gigantic war involving practically everybody.</p>
<p class="calibre9">The Third Age, where <em class="calibre5">Realms</em> games are mostly set, was the era of rebuilding, the long struggle for the restoration of the world.</p>
<p class="calibre9">Third Age Endoria was a dangerous place; it wasn’t noble, it wasn’t mystical, and it wasn’t especially dignified. Dwarves lied; elves slit throats. The land was a chaotic mess of factions and cultures and species. Different languages split the world, Coronishes and Zeldunics at each other’s throats. Rival deities and pantheons played games with the world, spawning curious groups like the Antic Brotherhood, which served the chaos daemon, Quareen, and the Nephros Concordance, with its vast and mysterious wealth. Different schools of wizardry competed for supremacy: Horn Adepts were masters of illusion; Summoners and Divinomancers were like cosmic hustlers, making deals with unseen entities, playing powerful forces against each other, always trying to come out ahead. Pyrists and Infomantics clung to their disciplines like addicts; Necromancers, like engineers of a rotting eldritch calculus. <a id="page-58"></a>The world was dirty, as if in that tournament all the shiny, high-fantasy idealism had been hacked to pieces and ground into the mud of the Second Age.</p>
<p class="calibre9">The Four Heroes’ lives continued, through sequel after sequel. There was no fictional justification for their extended life spans—did they have identical descendants, or did they just live a long time, as people in the Old Testament did? No one explained. Prendar was half elf and half human, and Lorac was a wizard, so they might plausibly have extended life spans, but even this was pushing it. (This was to say nothing of their twentieth-century and far-future analogues, for which no rational explanation suggested itself. <em class="calibre5">Realms</em> had a ludic dream logic of its own.) The Four Heroes were more like actors in a repertory company than stable characters. Nearly every story needed to fill one or more of their roles, “fighter” or “wizard” or “thief” or, well, “generic female person,” and they always showed up and did their bit. Sometimes they were a little older or younger than they were in previous games.</p>
<p class="calibre9">Were the characters supposed to remember everything that happened to them? If I asked one of them, would it know? It didn’t seem like it—most of the time they seemed paper-thin, just empty things you steered around the world to get what you wanted. No way to ask them, and no point to doing so. They weren’t even people; they were half people, you and not you, or the half of you that was in the world.</p>
<p class="calibre9">The Heroes met, adventured together, betrayed one another, reconciled, and even married (choice of Leira and Brennan or Leira and Prendar; I went with the latter). Lorac recovered the Staff of Wizardry and became the evil Dark Lorac for a while. Leira and Prendar ended up leading an army against the other two, and even had a son.</p>
<p class="calibre9">The Lich King rose, the last Elven Firstcomer died, and her knowledge was lost forever.</p>
<p class="calibre9">And of course they explored about a thousand dungeons and had a thousand adventures. There was the urban conspiracy one. The icy <a id="page-59"></a>northern one that explained the elven tribes, the one about the swamplands, the one about the dwarven empires, the weird plane-traveling one, the forestlands, the drowned ruins one, the vampire one.</p>
<p class="calibre9">The Heroes saved the world and acquired vast riches, as one does, but when next we would meet them they were always back to square one, broke and first-level. We wouldn’t have it any other way.</p>
<p class="calibre9">After that… things got weird. If you paged through enough rule supplements and unofficial spin-offs you could find rules for almost anything—rules in case characters dimension-traveled into the Old West or postapocalyptic Earth, for example.</p>
<p class="calibre9">The Soul Gem turned the time line back on itself, stretching and looping it forever. The Heroes even turned up in the First Age from time to time. Rumor had them fighting in the final siege of Chorn, or seeking out Adric from his wandering years and putting him on the path homeward. People said Leira’s child was Adric’s and was the true heir to the crown before he fell. Or that one day the far-future heroes Pren-Dahr, Ley-R4, Loraq, and Brendan Blackstar would travel back in time to save the Third Age, or perhaps doom it, whatever that means—people are always dooming things in fantasy. The Third Age kind of doomed everything anyway.</p>
<p class="calibre9">As I thought of it, the First Age was like childhood, years of long-ago upheaval, trauma, and unbearable longing, during which our characters were formed.</p>
<p class="calibre9">The Second Age was high school. Battle lines were drawn, alliances hardened into place, strategies tested, scars acquired. The crimes committed in this Age would fester for millennia.</p>
<p class="calibre9">And the Third Age was everything after, when we went our separate ways and order was restored but nothing quite forgiven or forgotten. There was also a Fourth Age no one much bothered with, which marked the retreat of magic into mere legend and superstition and the ascendancy of humankind—i.e., the time when we grew up and got boring and our hearts, generally speaking, died.</p>
<p class="calibre9"><a id="page-60"></a>I gathered there was a certain amount of armchair quarterbacking in the lower ranks of Black Arts, about how we were a little too loyal to the <em class="calibre5">Realms of Gold</em> thing. Don still believed the franchise had legs, that with the right game behind it, <em class="calibre5">RoG</em> could be as big as <em class="calibre5">Final Fantasy</em> or <em class="calibre5">Warcraft,</em> with bestselling tie-in novels, conventions, maybe a movie. But for now it was just another medieval pastiche, a sub-Narnian, off-brand Middle-earth, waiting to be a forgotten part of somebody’s adolescence, all the knights and ladies and dragon-elves left behind along with high school detention and Piers Anthony novels.</p>
<p class="calibre9">On the other hand, there were, out there, players who genuinely cared about the third Correllean dynasty, who read the cheaply ghostwritten tie-in novels, who were emotionally invested in the war against the House of Aerion, and who considered the death of Prince Vellan Brightsword in the Battle of Arn to be an event that genuinely diminished the amount of goodness and light in the world.</p>
<p class="calibre9">But it wasn’t as if Black Arts suffered from an exaggerated reverence for its own intellectual property. Maybe at first, but all the high-fantasy gravitas in the world wouldn’t survive the sight of Lorac hiking up his robes to nail a tricky hardflip-to-manual transition in <em class="calibre5">Pro Skate ’Em Endoria: Grind the Arch-Lich.</em></p>
<div class="topbot">
<p class="calibre9"><em class="calibre5">The four crowded awkwardly into the skate shop.</em></p>
<p class="calibre9"><em class="calibre5">“What are we doing here?” Brennan said, gazing around at racks of boards and skatewear.</em></p>
<p class="calibre9"><em class="calibre5">“I think it’s important,” whispered Leira. “I think we’re here for a reason.”</em></p>
<p class="calibre9"><em class="calibre5">Lorac scowled. “This is humiliating.”</em></p>
<p class="calibre9"><em class="calibre5">“Shred regular or goofy-foot?” asked the teenager behind the counter.</em></p>
<p class="calibre9"><em class="calibre5">“Regular?” Brennan said uncertainly. Leira and Prendar shrugged—regular would be fine. After an agonizing pause, Lorac replied, “Goofy.”</em></p>
<p class="calibre9"><em class="calibre5">The skate shop attendant showed them an array of possible T-shirts. Lorac chose a black one. He was a necromancer, after all.</em></p>
<p class="calibre9"><a id="page-61"></a><em class="calibre5">They found themselves in the parking lot of Franklin Delano Roosevelt Elementary.</em></p>
<p class="calibre9"><em class="calibre5">“Skate!” cried the arch-lich. “Skate!”</em></p>
<p class="calibre9"><em class="calibre5">Brennan scanned the others’ faces grimly. “Aye. We will skate.”</em></p>
<p class="calibre9"><em class="calibre5">They learned to ollie and nollie and heelflip and air it out and, yes, grind. Prendar kept an eye out for cop cars while Leira tentatively worked out half-pipe moves in a concrete spillway to a grunge-and-speed-metal sound track. Lorac had promise as a tech skateboarder; Brennan went in for vert. When perfected, his double-handed Decapitation-Vacation 360-degree grab raked in a huge bonus.</em></p>
<p class="calibre9"><em class="calibre5">They improved. They got licensing deals and won competitions. And there really were moments when GtA-L came mind-bendingly close to working. Prendar gliding through the suburban gloom, elf ears glimpsed for a moment under a streetlight, then just a shadow as he rounded the corner of a Safeway and disappeared. Lorac closed his eyes a moment as he rolled down the long hill toward downtown, felt the sun on his face, set aside, for the time being, his long years of study, the price of his arcane knowledge, the doom waiting for him. He ollied to grind the curb, nollied into a 360 to land clean. He grinned.</em></p>
<p class="calibre9"><em class="calibre5">When Leira managed a handplant on the edge of an abandoned public pool to the cranked-up sound of surfpunk guitar, it almost made sense of the insanity, her body extended almost vertically in the last light of day, her arm straight on the lip, supporting her body, her back arched against the sunset, orange light glinting liquid off the centuries-old katana strapped to her back and pouring over the grass that was poking through the concrete, over the trash piled against a sagging chain-link fence.</em></p>
<p class="calibre9"><em class="calibre5">“Skate! Skate, or taste the wrath of the arch-lich!”</em></p>
</div>
<p class="space-break">That night as I was falling asleep I noticed a light through the crack under the cheap door dividing my apartment’s two rooms. At first I thought the refrigerator door hadn’t closed, but when I looked, I found that the Four Heroes of Endoria had showed up to visit.</p>
<p class="calibre9"><a id="page-62"></a>It was unexpected, and I wasn’t set up for company; in fact, I had exactly one card table and one folding chair, which Lorac the wizard had claimed. They were a striking quartet, larger than life, angular in the way of computer models.</p>
<p class="calibre9">Their glowing, pixelated forms took up a surprising amount of room. Brennan was nearly seven feet tall, and his broad shoulders seemed to swallow up the entire kitchen.</p>
<p class="calibre9">“What are you doing in my kitchen?” I asked them.</p>
<p class="calibre9">“My friend, the time has come to embark on our quest,” he said in the smooth baritone of the semiprofessional voice actor who recorded his dialogue.</p>
<p class="calibre9">I guessed, sure, we were friends, in a way.</p>
<p class="calibre9">“You are the chosen one,” said Princess Leira, who leaned against the sink. She had the requisite Amazonian figure, full red lips, and jet black hair. She had bright eyes and a mouth that drooped at the corners, which gave her smile an appealing, sheepish quality. She wore a traveling cloak, which was a relief; some of her costumes were pretty revealing.</p>
<p class="calibre9">“Chosen for what? What quest?” I asked. “I don’t understand. Am I supposed to find something?” We were always finding things in games. Rings, books, crowns.</p>
<p class="calibre9">“You’re the one we need,” said Prendar the thief, a tall, pale half elf with sandy red hair and black eyes. “A man of courage and strength, but also guile.”</p>
<p class="calibre9">I’d never seen an elf up close before. From a distance they were graceful, elegant beings, but from a few feet away Prendar was vibrantly inhuman. You’d think an elf would have a cute snub nose, but his was long and beaky. Maybe it was his human father’s. I’d never heard the word <em class="calibre5">guile</em> used in a conversation, either.</p>
<p class="calibre9">“Russell, we entreat your help,” intoned the magus. “Our worlds are in great danger, and only you can save them.” His cloak stiff with whorls of gold thread, Lorac spoke with a theatrical old-guy quaver. <a id="page-63"></a>He was an Arabian Nights character, an exotic older man with a Levantine cast, a thin, crooked nose, and a neatly trimmed beard. His staff was too long, and he brushed the dusty lighting fixture with it. “Sorry.”</p>
<p class="calibre9">“But you’re the Heroes,” I said. “It doesn’t make any sense for you to talk to humans.”</p>
<p class="calibre9">“We’re all in the game, Russell,” Leira said. “We’re characters, but you’re the player. We need you.”</p>
<p class="calibre9">“A great danger is coming,” said Brennan. “Greater than any we have ever faced.”</p>
<p class="calibre9">“Beware Adric! Beware the grieving blade!” Leira whispered breathlessly.</p>
<p class="calibre9">“Just play the game, asshole,” Prendar snapped, and drew on a cigarette.</p>
<p class="calibre9">“Wait… what game?” I said. “<em class="calibre5">Realms VI</em>? <em class="calibre5">VII</em>?”</p>
<p class="calibre9">“The Ultimate Game,” sing-songed Lorac. He began to laugh. They must have gotten a really good voice actor. Looking closer, I saw that his staff had a small animal skull on the end of it. It might have been a ferret’s. The ferret’s eyes glowed.</p>
<p class="calibre9">I fell asleep again, and this time dreamed I was still at work but there was an extra office marked Secret Projects, and I went in and found Simon there where he’d been all along and he told me how he’d built the Ultimate Game and it was just a golden ring, and he said he’d already spoken the wish and tomorrow the five of us would wake up and be fantasy adventurers together like I’d always wanted. I’d get to be the elf. I started crying right then and there, I just thought, what a relief, because I remembered now how much I wanted it. How had I forgotten that?</p>
