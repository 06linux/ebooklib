<p class="noindent"><span class="dropcap">L</span>orac, do you think Lisa likes me?”</p>
<p class="calibre9">“Like-likes you?”</p>
<p class="calibre9">“Yeah.”</p>
<p class="calibre9">“This seems more like a Brennan question.”</p>
<p class="calibre9">“Can’t you do magic to figure this out?”</p>
<p class="calibre9">He sketched a quick little figure in a puddle with the tip of his staff and frowned at the ripples. “You don’t know her that well, do you?”</p>
<p class="calibre9">“No. She’s pretty hard to read.”</p>
<p class="calibre9">I wondered if Brennan wouldn’t indeed have been a better person to ask.</p>
<p class="calibre9">“Should I ask her out?”</p>
<p class="calibre9">He shrugs. It’s not really a Lorac question, but he’s the only one around. “Why not?”</p>
<p class="calibre9">“But what would happen?”</p>
<p class="calibre9">“I can see the future, but only in parts and only under third-edition rules, the augury and divination spells.”</p>
<p class="calibre9">“All right. What do they do?”</p>
<p class="calibre9">“This is augury: Caster may dwell on a proposed course of action and receive a general sense of its outcome, positive or negative.” He mumbled a few words under his breath and drew a complex polygon in the air with one finger.</p>
<p class="calibre9">“Well?”</p>
<p class="calibre9"><a id="page-274"></a>“Basically it turns out all right, I suppose. Mingled essences of relief, bliss, regret, anger.”</p>
<p class="calibre9">“What? That sounds like it sucks. What about divination?”</p>
<p class="calibre9">“Divination: Caster may dwell on a proposed course of action and receive specific images, clues, and impressions regarding the short- and long-term outcome and consequences.”</p>
<p class="calibre9">“Okay, so try that.”</p>
<p class="calibre9">He hesitated.</p>
<p class="calibre9">“Very well.” He pushed a few chairs apart then dimmed the lights. He knelt without apparent difficulty for a sixtysomething magician, fished a piece of chalk from within his robes, and began sketching a complex figure on the floor, a bit like a crab.</p>
<p class="calibre9">“I’m drawing a little diagram of what time looks like if you’re looking straight into it—like looking down a tunnel and seeing a circle, if the tunnel were an angry ten-dimensional crab, which is what, in vastly oversimplified terms, we mean by the human word <em class="calibre5">time</em>.”</p>
<p class="calibre9">He rapidly sang an arcane song under his breath—the words weren’t in any human language; the melody was close to “California Girls.”</p>
<p class="calibre9">“What does it show?”</p>
<p class="calibre9">“Not sure,” he said.</p>
<p class="calibre9">“Come on. I thought you were a wizard.”</p>
<p class="calibre9">He sighed, then he looked at me with eyes that had seen the top three levels of the abyss, that had looked out across countless battlefields and into the eyes of the Lich King. “If I tell you, will you swear to stop bothering me?”</p>
<p class="calibre9">“Fine.”</p>
<p class="calibre9">“First of all, I can’t really tell if she like-likes you,” he began. “But she’s lawful neutral.”</p>
<p class="calibre9">“And?”</p>
<p class="calibre9">When he was done, I knew a bit more than I wanted to, and none of it answered my question.</p>
<p class="calibre9"><a id="page-275"></a>Some of it I already knew. I knew that Lisa’s mother was a librarian, her father was a paleontologist. She was an only child.</p>
<p class="calibre9">I knew she was five feet tall for most of high school and carried a huge backpack, so she had to walk looking up a little. She got beaten up by a group of older girls once, and didn’t tell her parents.</p>
<p class="calibre9">She got crushes no one knew about. She drew in her textbooks. When her father bought an Apple][Plus, she didn’t know girls weren’t supposed to use it. She played Sierra On-Line games and solved <em class="calibre5">Mystery House</em> in a long weekend.</p>
<p class="calibre9">Her first serious boyfriend was in freshman year of college. He was notionally a playwright. For six months they were that couple that was <em class="calibre5">always</em> making out in public. Then later you just noticed they were never in the same room together.</p>
<p class="calibre9">After sixth grade she stopped having friends for a long time. Lots of people joked that she was a witch or a lesbian. She thought about whether she should be a witch. Her parents had all kinds of books in the house. She read <em class="calibre5">The Anarchist Cookbook</em> and the <em class="calibre5">Whole Earth Catalog</em>. Her dad died.</p>
<p class="calibre9">Somehow everybody at school knew about it, and they were surprisingly decent. She started eating lunch with a circle of people from honors English. She didn’t actually hate people. She sang second soprano in the school choir. She had a short, intense friendship with a tall girl named Sarah that ended abruptly.</p>
<p class="calibre9">A lot of boys who went to high school with her developed severe retroactive crushes on her in college, all around the end of sophomore year.</p>
<p class="calibre9">Computer science is a good discipline if you like to be left alone.</p>
<p class="calibre9">She last got in a fight in fifth grade. It didn’t stop until two teachers pulled her off, a fact no one at school ever seemed to forget. The other girl has a tiny discolored patch near her right cheekbone from where her face rubbed against the asphalt. They never became friends.</p>
<p class="calibre9">She wrote stories in a notebook in a big looping hand that her teacher <a id="page-276"></a>let her turn in for extra credit, a lot of which were about time travel. She even wrote a rambling novella stretched over several spiral-bound notebooks. She made a graphic adventure game based on it and gave it to her mother as a birthday present. Her mother kept it on a shelf but she never played it.</p>
<p class="space-break">Junior year of college she started hanging out in the twenty-four-hour computer lab more. She tried smoking pot. Her roommates stopped seeing much of her. They’d see her sleeping in a pile of clothes during the day. That spring she had a series of one-night stands, mostly with people she met at parties at the campus radio station, where she was interning as a sound engineer. She started hanging out with the same group of CS majors a lot. Some of them knew Simon. She went on elevator surfing expeditions, and smoked even more pot. She started collecting copies of building keys. She got a semiregular boyfriend that her roommates hated. She threw up from drinking for the first time. At Christmas her mother asked her if she thought she needed therapy.</p>
<p class="calibre9">She started drinking more. She had a line of green Jägermeister bottles on the windowsill of her dorm room. She still slept a lot during the day. That fall she failed a class. Her honors thesis was entitled “A Closed-Form Solution to the Radiance Transfer between Two Distant Spheres,” and it drew a lot of attention from the faculty. In January, she started avoiding her adviser. One night her roommates heard a sound, half sobbing, half screaming, and found her with a bunch of 3.25-inch disks she had snapped in half.</p>
<p class="calibre9">Her roommates finally told her boyfriend to stop calling. She finished her thesis and graduated late, with honors. Simon offered her a job, which she turned down. That summer, fall, and spring she lived with her mother in her old room, which was probably the last happy period in her life. She applied to the Columbia grad program in computer science, got in, and moved to the city. She was the kind of person old people in her building liked and the people at the bodega said hi to <a id="page-277"></a>every day. She still smoked pot sometimes; she went to department happy hours and campus <em class="calibre5">Star Trek</em> marathons and contra dancing. She had her last name legally changed. She did research on natural language processing. She quit after a year and a half. She e-mailed Simon and asked him for a job and moved to a big group house in Somerville with a mix of software engineers, IT workers, and engineering students.</p>
<p class="calibre9">She had dinner with her mother twice a week. She saw a therapist who made notes about low affect and a thing called dismissive-avoidant attachment style. She got asked a lot about the period around her father’s death. She stopped going after four months. She still read a lot of science fiction.</p>
