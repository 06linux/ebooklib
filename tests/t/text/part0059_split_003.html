<h1 id="a003" class="head">The Spindrift War</h1>
<p class="noindent">The view scale jumps again, and humanity’s existence is threatened, and it’s time to exploit, which is the third <em class="calibre5">X</em>. Asteroids are quarried into massive fleets equipped with the Improved Gravity Splice. Combat is now too fast to follow on a tactical level, so you learn to program artificial intelligence systems. The weapons are terrible: entire planets are shattered and stars implode on your orders. By the time the Terpsichore <a id="page-336"></a>Myriad (for so they call themselves) is exterminated, the human dominion comprises six hundred million stars (out of the galaxy’s two hundred billion) and thirty thousand light-years, almost a third of the way across the galaxy, but still far short of your goal.
