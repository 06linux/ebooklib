<p class="calibre9">Excerpts follow:</p>
<div class="speech">
<p class="bhang">Don: We’re going to start from story with this. Games are never going to grow up until they tell a proper story, can we agree?</p>
</div>
<p class="calibre9"><em class="calibre5">(Everyone nods. It seems true. Movies have story, and characters and emotion. And our whole goal is to make a game that’s like living in a movie. And then movies will go away, and we will reign supreme.)</em></p>
<div class="speech"><p class="bhang"><a id="page-112"></a>Don: Russell’s going to be the one executing the story, but I want to come up with the main idea together. Let’s brainstorm a little about the scenario.</p></div>
<p class="calibre9"><em class="calibre5">(Don looks up expectantly at our silent, reluctant faces. It feels like somebody else should be doing this, but this was it.)</em></p>
<div class="speech"><p class="bhang">Lisa: Is there a starting point? What do we already know for sure?</p>
<p class="bhang">Me: Well, we know it’s the Third Age. And we’re dealing with Brennan and he’s on a quest. For the Hyperborean Crown.</p>
<p class="bhang">Don: What is the crown, exactly?</p>
<p class="bhang">Matt: Well, it’s a First Age artifact, so not that much has been said about it. It belonged to a prince named Adric, but it was in play long before that. Crown of an elder civilization. Like the Númenóreans.</p>
<p class="bhang">Don: [Feigned comprehension]</p>
<p class="bhang">Me: It was the big prize in <em class="calibre5">Realms of Gold I</em>. Sort of cool for the fans to see it again.</p>
<p class="bhang">Don: Okay.</p>
<p class="bhang">Lisa: What’s Hyperborean?</p>
<p class="bhang">Me [primly]: Hyperborean means “from the north.”</p>
<p class="bhang">Don: That’s going to look like shit on the back of the box. No one wants to find that thing.</p>
<p class="bhang">Lisa: We could say “Crown of the North.”</p>
<p class="bhang">Don: That works.</p>
<p class="bhang">Me and Matt [simultaneously]: It’s not canon.</p>
<p class="bhang">Don: Canon can be flexible, though, right? Darren modified a lot of things over the years.</p></div>
<p class="calibre9"><em class="calibre5">(Matt and I nod, telepathically agreeing to use “Hyperborean” anyway; if they catch us and make us take it out, so be it.)</em></p>
<div class="speech"><p class="bhang"><a id="page-113"></a>Don: So a long time ago—what?</p></div>
<p class="calibre9"><em class="calibre5">(Matt has cleared his throat.)</em></p>
<div class="speech"><p class="bhang">Matt: There’s some argument that <em class="calibre5">Realms</em> is set in the far future—</p>
<p class="bhang">Lisa [hastily]: Who exactly is Brennan?</p>
<p class="bhang">Me: Your basic RPG hero, handsome, muscular. Younger son of the House of Aerion, which was defeated in the Fool’s Gold War. That’s where we start. So…</p>
<p class="bhang">Don: The House of Aerion’s in danger?</p>
<p class="bhang">Me: It already got its ass kicked.</p>
<p class="bhang">Matt: Leira’s in danger?</p>
<p class="bhang">Lisa: It’s out of character. Plus enough with the princess thing. Prendar’s in danger?</p>
<p class="bhang">Me: I think that would be weird.</p>
<p class="bhang">Lisa: I don’t really know why I’m here. I don’t really do fantasy.</p>
<p class="bhang">Don: Woman’s perspective.</p>
<p class="bhang">Me: Brennan’s just starting out in this one; he doesn’t know these guys yet. He’s just left home.</p>
<p class="bhang">Don: So Brennan’s an exile, he wants to get his throne back. He wants to go home, right? So what’s stopping him?</p>
<p class="bhang">Me: Uh, accused of a crime he never committed? Every man’s hand is against him, he must clear his name with the help of his friends, find the crown, and set the kingdom to rights.</p>
<p class="bhang">Don: [Nods. What more need be said?] So where does the crown end up being?</p>
<p class="bhang">Lisa: “Crown of the North.”</p>
<p class="bhang">Matt: The end of the Third Age is when Soroth the ice dragon descends from the Pole and brings winter to the Perrenwood and the Tomb opens.</p>
<p class="bhang">Don: Wasn’t Soroth dead?</p>
<p class="bhang"><a id="page-114"></a>Matt: Well, in the War of All Souls he flies to the Lich King’s aid in battle. He was driven off, but no one says if he died. In fact, he’s glimpsed by Leira Prime about two hundred years later in the skies, heralding the end of the age.</p>
<p class="bhang">Don: Leira Prime is…</p>
<p class="bhang">Matt: In some versions of history Leira gets to the end of the Third Age but goes back in time to marry Prendar and has their son, who later becomes the Lich King, following the corruption of the Circle of Seven per Second Age prophecy…</p>

<p class="blockquote-firstpara">… which is why Lorac turns dark in the first place.</p>
<div class="topbot">
<p class="blockquote-firstpara"><em class="calibre5">(Pause)</em></p>
</div>
<p class="bhang">Lisa: But—last question—what exactly is the crown? Like, what are its powers? Why do they want it so much, anyway?</p>
<p class="bhang">Matt: To start with, I think a substantial to-hit and damage bonus.</p>
<p class="bhang">Don: Okay, well, what we have is, Brennan’s exiled, looking for this crown, meets his friends, they go up against the ice dragon. Working title?</p>
<p class="bhang">Matt: <em class="calibre5">Realms of Gold: Dark Lorac.</em></p>
<p class="bhang">Lisa: <em class="calibre5">Realms of Gold: Ice Dragon.</em></p>
<p class="bhang">Matt: Soroth Strikes.</p>
<p class="bhang">Lisa: Dragon of Ice.</p>
<p class="bhang">Don: There’s a winter theme.</p>
<p class="bhang">Gabby: He’s, like, ending the winter.</p>
<p class="bhang">Matt: Winter’s End.</p>
<p class="bhang">Lisa: Not-winter-anymore. Or maybe just “Spring.”</p>
<p class="bhang">Don: Let’s think about the goal here.</p>
<p class="bhang"><a id="page-115"></a>Me: King of the North.</p>
<p class="bhang">Matt: Crown of the North.</p>
<p class="bhang">Me: Arctic Ascension.</p>
<p class="bhang">Lisa: Behold the Northcrown.</p>
<p class="bhang">Matt: Crown of Ice.</p>
<p class="bhang">Lisa: Seek Ye the Northcrown.</p>
<p class="bhang">Don: We get it.</p>
<p class="bhang">Matt: Crown of Frost!</p>
<p class="bhang">Lisa: Crown of Winter!</p>
<p class="bhang">Me: Winter’s Crown!</p></div>
