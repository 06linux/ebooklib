<p class="calibre9">The words came up in a monospaced font in a white-bordered window; the letters were all white except for the words “Fun Stuff,” each letter of which was a different color of the rainbow. It was almost comically dated, but it was also impossible to see it without remembering what it felt like to be on the cutting edge of 1983.</p>

<p class="calibre9"><em class="calibre5">Adric’s Tomb</em> was a very primitive dungeon game, all glowing green dots and dashes, the old bones of the virtual realities of the nineties. Rows and columns of alphanumeric characters on a black screen were arranged in a simple maze that only to a very charitable imagination would stand in for the mossy stone walls and dank, silent corridors where Adric’s body lay, no doubt in the form of a melancholy percentage sign. At the center of the maze there stood a single plus sign, +, and that was you. Whee. Hard to believe this thing shared a code base with the real-time 3-D world of fourteen years later.</p>
<p class="calibre9">It was easy to laugh at, like the first flying machines, with their pedals and stacks of redundant wings. But at the same time, the simulation had the eloquence of a cave painting. Once I’d touched it, I’d touched a program powered by the same imaginative electricity that powered every video game ever made, except this one was that much closer to <a id="page-73"></a>the source. If the tech was primitive, the urge to make it shone through that much more strongly.</p>
<p class="calibre9">I waited for something to happen, then realized it was waiting for me. This was a turn-based world. I pressed <em class="calibre5">H</em> on the keyboard and the plus sign advanced one space to the left, then stopped. Time ground forward one turn, and then halted until I pressed the key again.</p>
<p class="calibre9">I had a sudden rush of sense memory—the smell of paint fumes, lingering school lunches, damp wool drying after late autumn rain. I really did know these people, once upon a time, it’s just that I knew them when we were different people; when I was a different person, one that I’d tried for a long time to forget. When I saw them again we were all changed enough that I could feel safely at that remove—we were all older, fatter, clever enough that we could wink and say, well, at least we’re much cleverer than the people we used to be, right? But <em class="calibre5">Adric’s Tomb</em> hadn’t changed.</p>
<p class="space-break">We met in the fall, the four of us—Darren, Simon, Lisa, and me. We’d all signed up for the intro to programming elective as sophomores. It was taught by a slightly shabby thirtyish math teacher named Kovacs, an enthusiast who had a prominent mustache and published regularly in <em class="calibre5">Creative Computing</em> magazine. He was dismissed a few years afterward for smoking pot.</p>
<p class="calibre9">We sat at the back, not together but away from the in crowd, the clique of seniors in advanced integral calc who took all of Kovacs’s classes, whatever they were. I knew them by sight: Simon and Darren, the mismatched friends, and Lisa Muckenhaupt, her long hair still wet from the dash across the quad. She was known for reading while walking the two miles to and from junior high, paperback science fiction held in front of her. She wore a lot of long, deeply unfashionable proto–Ren faire dresses, and had, as far as I knew, no friends whatsoever.</p>
<p class="calibre9">I would love to say I remember why I went, but probably it was just a résumé builder. I was already looking ahead to college applications. I <a id="page-74"></a>never found out exactly why the others were there. Lisa was a math jock, so it made sense. For Darren and Simon it was one of those mysterious decisions that emanated out of their collective mind.</p>
<p class="calibre9">We split into groups of four, one group per computer. Kovacs shoved us together without thinking about it. We stood around the computer, shooting tentative glances at one another. I thought Lisa was going to step forward, but Darren smiled and pulled the chair out and gestured for Simon to sit. We started in on the canonical first assignment: write and compile a program to display the words <em class="calibre5">Hello, world</em>. After which Darren pushed us forward into: write and compile a program to display the words <em class="calibre5">ANARCHY RULES</em>.</p>
<p class="calibre9">Lisa, who evidently had a computer at home, leaned over in front of Simon, hair brushing the keyboard, and added a looping structure: write and compile a program to display the words <em class="calibre5">ANARCHY RULES</em> an infinite number of times. Mission accomplished.</p>
<p class="calibre9">At the end of class, Kovacs explained that each group would be responsible for a semester project, a long-form complete program of our own design.</p>
<p class="calibre9">Darren said, “We should do a game.”</p>
<p class="calibre9">“Is that allowed?” asked Lisa.</p>
<p class="calibre9">“Why not?” Darren countered.</p>
<p class="calibre9">Simon nodded. “We should do it.”</p>
<p class="calibre9">“What kind of game?” I asked.</p>
<p class="calibre9">“Like <em class="calibre5">D&amp;D,</em>” Simon and Darren said in unison.</p>
<p class="calibre9">“Just as long as it’s not stupid. What do you think, Russell?” She looked at me.</p>
<p class="calibre9">“Fine, I guess,” I said. I barely knew what <em class="calibre5">Dungeons &amp; Dragons</em> was, and I didn’t have any other ideas, so why not?</p>
<p class="calibre9">“Couldn’t we do science fiction?” Lisa asked. “Did you guys read <em class="calibre5">Foundation</em>?” I’d learn later that Lisa had an incomprehensible bond with the long, dry, future-history sagas of Asimov and Olaf Stapledon.</p>
<p class="calibre9">In the end it came down to a coin flip, fantasy versus science fiction. <a id="page-75"></a>Fantasy won, and we wrote down our phone numbers for each other so we could meet later. In a year of firsts, it was the first time I received a girl’s phone number in her own jagged handwriting. It was the second time Simon had touched a computer, and he left the classroom with Mr. Kovacs’s copy of <em class="calibre5">Structured COBOL Programming,</em> second edition, by Nancy and Robert Stern, under his T-shirt.</p>
